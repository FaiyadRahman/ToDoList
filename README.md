# ToDoList - https://todolist-khvd.onrender.com

This is a To-Do list I made to explore using databases using MongoDB and mongoose. It was a great way of learning CRUD operations. It is very rudamentary at the moment but it supports the basic functions such as Adding/Deleting tasks, and custom lists. Right now its just a global list, but I will be adding user authentication and user specific lists.

To start a custom, simply go to https://todolist-khvd.onrender.com/ + custom list name
for example: https://todolist-khvd.onrender.com/test
