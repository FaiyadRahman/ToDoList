# ToDoList

This is a To-Do list I made to explore using databases using MongoDB and mongoose. It was a great way of learning CRUD operations. It is very rudamentary at the moment but it supports the basic functions such as Adding/Deleting task, and custom lists. Right now its just a global list, but I will be adding user authentication and user specific lists.
